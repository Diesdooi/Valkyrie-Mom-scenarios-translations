EventPrologo2.text,8 December 1931 \n\n You have received a letter from a mysterious Transylvanian Count, inviting you to his castle to assist in cataloguing and deciphering some ancient artifacts stored in his personal collection. \n\n With great interest in this collection, you start the journey from London on a cold December morning. You are travelling by train for three days through the beautiful landscape of Austria via the Danube River. \n\n You decide to ask other passengers about the man that you are about to visit - a certain Count Dracula, but their reactions are evasive. Many passengers retire away to other train cars without saying anything, though they have marked expressions of fear and repeatedly make the sign of the cross whilst mumbling something incoherent in their native tongue. \n\n At the end of the third day, you can see the silhouette of the Carpathian Mountains, one of the most wild and unknown regions in Europe.
